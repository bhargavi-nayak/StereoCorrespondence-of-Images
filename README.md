# StereoCorrespondence-of-Images
It is an image processing based project to find the occlusion in the stereo images where we have used the Semi Global Block Matching algorithm (SGBM) to determine the disparity map. The disparity map is nothing but the depth information related to the stereo images. After obtaining the disparity map we have calculated the number of occluded pixels in the obtained disparity map. Then the disparity map is refined using the post-processing technique which involves filling the occluded pixels with the help of the inpainting technique.
